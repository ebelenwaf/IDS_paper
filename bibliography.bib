abstract="This chapter provides the overview of the state of the art in intrusion detection research. Intrusion detection systems are software and/or hardware components that monitor computer systems and analyze events occurring in them for signs of intrusions. Due to widespread diversity and complexity of computer infrastructures, it is difficult to provide a completely secure computer system. Therefore, there are numerous security systems and intrusion detection systems that address different aspects of computer security. This chapter first provides taxonomy of computer intrusions, along with brief descriptions of major computer attack categories. Second, a common architecture of intrusion detection systems and their basic characteristics are presented. Third, taxonomy of intrusion detection systems based on five criteria (information source, analysis strategy, time aspects, architecture, response) is given. Finally, intrusion detection systems are classified according to each of these categories and the most representative research prototypes are briefly described.",

We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, generality, and robustness aspects of the methods.

	abstract = {Given a stream of heterogeneous graphs containing different types of nodes and edges, how can we spot anomalous ones in real-time while consuming bounded memory? This problem is motivated by and generalizes from its application in security to host-level advanced persistent threat (APT) detection. We propose StreamSpot, a clustering based anomaly detection approach that addresses challenges in two key fronts: (1) heterogeneity, and (2) streaming nature. We introduce a new similarity function for heterogeneous graphs that compares two graphs based on their relative frequency of local substructures, represented as short strings. This function lends itself to a vector representation of a graph, which is (a) fast to compute, and (b) amenable to a sketched version with bounded size that preserves similarity. StreamSpot exhibits desirable properties that a streaming application requires: it is (i) fully-streaming; processing the stream one edge at a time as it arrives, (ii) memory-efficient; requiring constant space for the sketches and the clustering, (iii) fast; taking constant time to update the graph sketches and the cluster summaries that can process over 100,000 edges per second, and (iv) online; scoring and flagging anomalies in real time. Experiments on datasets containing simulated system-call flow graphs from normal browser activity and various attack scenarios (ground truth) show that StreamSpot is high-performance; achieving above 95\% detection accuracy with small delay, as well as competitive time and memory usage.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

The existing clustering algorithm in literature is the approximate algorithms, which cluster the underlying data differently for different datasets. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is suitable for frequency but not for binary form. When an application runs several system calls are implicitly invoked in the background. Based on these system calls we can predict the normal or abnormal behavior of applications. This can be done by classification. In this paper we tried to perform classification of processes running into normal and abnormal states by using system call behavior. We reduce the system call feature vector by choosing k-means algorithm which uses the proposed measure for dimensionality reduction. We give the design of the proposed measure. The proposed measure has upper and lower bounds which are finite.},

	abstract = {End-to-end tracing has emerged recently as a valuable tool to improve the dependability of distributed systems by performing dynamic verification and diagnosing cor-rectness and performance problems. End-to-end traces are commonly represented as richly annotated directed acyclic graphs, with events as nodes and their causal dependencies as edges. Being able to automatically compare these graphs at scale is a key primitive for tasks such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection. In this paper we explore recent developments in the theory of graph kernels, and investigate the feasibility of using a family of kernels based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test [35] as an efficient and robust graph comparison primitive. We find that graph kernels provide a good formulation of the execution graph comparison problem, and present preliminary but encouraging results on their ability to distinguish high-level differences between execution graphs.},

This paper presents three anomaly detection techniques for profiling program behavior that evolve from memorization to generalization. The goal of monitoring program behavior is to be able to detect potential intrusions by noting irregularities in program behavior. The techniques start from a simple equality matching algorithm for determining anomalous behavior, and evolve to a feed-forward backpropagation neural network for learning program behavior, and finally to an Elman network for recognizing recurrent features in program execution traces. In order to detect future attacks against systems, intrusion detection systems must be able to generalize from past observed behavior. The goal of this research is to employ machine learning techniques that can generalize from past observed behavior to the problem of intrusion detection. The performance of these systems is compared by testing them with data provided by the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation program.},

The potential sources of outliers include noise and errors, events, and malicious attacks on the network. Traditional outlier detection techniques are not directly applicable to wireless sensor networks due to the nature of sensor data and specific requirements and limitations of the wireless sensor networks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing outlier detection techniques specifically developed for the wireless sensor networks. Additionally, it presents a technique-based taxonomy and a comparative table to be used as a guideline to select a technique suitable for the application at hand based on characteristics such as data type, outlier type, outlier identity, and outlier degree.},

For example, the main concern of clustering-based outlier detection algorithms is to find clusters and outliers, which are often regarded as noise that should be removed in order to make more reliable clustering. In this article, we present an algorithm that provides outlier detection and data clustering simultaneously. The algorithm improves the estimation of centroids of the generative distribution during the process of clustering and outlier discovery. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage consists of improved genetic k-means algorithm (IGK) process, while the second stage iteratively removes the vectors which are far from their cluster centroids.},

Results are given for determining the optimal operation of an IDS based on this expected cost metric. Results are given for the operation of a single IDS and for a combination of two IDSs. The method is illustrated for: 1) determining the best operating point for a single and double IDS based on the costs of mistakes and the hostility of the operating environment as represented in the prior probability of intrusion and 2) evaluating single and double IDSs on the basis of expected cost. A method is also described for representing a compound IDS as an equivalent single IDS. Results are presented from the point of view of a system administrator, but they apply equally to designers of IDSs.},

	abstract = {A number of applications in social networks, telecommunications, and mobile computing create massive streams of graphs. In many such applications, it is useful to detect structural abnormalities which are different from the “typical” behavior of the underlying network. In this paper, we will provide first results on the problem of structural outlier detection in massive network streams. Such problems are inherently challenging, because the problem of outlier detection is specially challenging because of the high volume of the underlying network stream. The stream scenario also increases the computational challenges for the approach. We use a structural connectivity model in order to define outliers in graph streams. In order to handle the sparsity problem of massive networks, we dynamically partition the network in order to construct statistically robust models of the connectivity behavior. We design a reservoir sampling method in order to maintain structural summaries of the underlying network. These structural summaries are designed in order to create robust, dynamic and efficient models for outlier detection in graph streams. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract="Web graphs are approximate snapshots of the web, created by search engines. They are essential to monitor the evolution of the web and to compute global properties like PageRank values of web pages. Their continuous monitoring requires a notion of graph similarity to help measure the amount and significance of changes in the evolving web. As a result, these measurements provide means to validate how well search engines acquire content from the web. In this paper, we propose five similarity schemes: three of them we adapted from existing graph similarity measures, and two we adapted from well-known document and vector similarity methods (namely, the shingling method and random projection based method). We empirically evaluate and compare all five schemes using a sequence of web graphs from Yahoo!, and study if the schemes can identify anomalies that may occur due to hardware or other problems.",
